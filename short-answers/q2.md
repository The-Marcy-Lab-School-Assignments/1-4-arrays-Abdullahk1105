# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Is `addBostonToFavorites` a pure function? Why or why not?

# Answer

NO this is NOT a pure function. In order for function to be pure it doesn't need to depend on any external variables and it has the same `output` and `input` and **no change to external variables**. As we can see this function uses the .unshift() method to add Boston to the beginning of the array.
